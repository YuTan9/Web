					Most striking in the Cavaliers' 116-86 win over the Celtics in Game 3 wasn’t the continued brilliance of LeBron James or the belated arrival of his supporting cast. It was the sight of a Boston team without its focus—an increasingly rare case of this young core acting its age. <br>
					Until Saturday night, Boston’s attention to detail ranked among the most reliable constants in these playoffs. To a man, the Celtics execute. Al Horford raises the baseline on both ends of the floor with his cerebral play, from which Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier can springboard into dynamic moves. Their success stems not only from what they run, but how precisely they run it. Brad Stevens can scheme his defense with the knowledge that most possessions will end in a perfect closeout. He can draw up delicately timed plays full of misdirection because his players can enact them to the slightest squiggle on his whiteboard.<br>
					Those Celtics, for whatever reason, did not make it to Cleveland in time for Game 3. A different energy was to be expected; the Cavs may have put themselves at a considerable disadvantage by losing the first two games of the series, but a third would effectively end it. This game could never be as important to Boston as it was to Cleveland, and as such the Celtics would have to match the Cavs’ urgency with something else.
