					Why does the NBA's Robin Lopez keep fighting with team mascots?

					(CNN)It's called basketball, not pro wrestling. Right?
				</p>
				<p>
					But the on-court antics by Chicago Bulls center Robin Lopez when he clashes with mascots from opposing teams feels like we're watching a WWE championship.
				</p>
				<p>
					Bulls fans had little to cheer about this season -- so at least Lopez provided a reason to root for the team.
				</p>
				<p>
					The roughhousing ranges from Lopez putting wrestling holds on opposing mascots to battling them with Star Wars light sabers or even hitting them on the head with poster boards.
				</p>
				<p>
					Lopez by the way has a twin. NBA center Brooke Lopez of the Brooklyn Nets also acts out his need to mess with mascots.
				</p>
				<p>
					But Robin Lopez -- who grew up in California -- has a lighter side too. In an interview with Oregon's Willamette Week, he talked about his love for comic books and golden-age Hollywood musicals.
				</p>
				<p>
					Now, his mascot activities have earned him the nickname "Sideshow Rob." To open this NBA season he had a pair of custom made "Sideshow Robs" basketball kicks made that he shared with his Twitter audience.
