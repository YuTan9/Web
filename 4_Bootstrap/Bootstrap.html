		<h1>Ray Allen</h1>
		<h6>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h6>
		<p><abbr title = "BEST SHOOTER OF ALL TIME!!!">Walter Ray Allen Jr.</abbr> (born July 20, 1975) is an American retired professional basketball player who played 18 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). After playing three seasons of college basketball for Connecticut, Allen entered the NBA in 1996 and went on to play for the Milwaukee Bucks, Seattle SuperSonics, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat. One of the most accurate three-point and free throw shooters in NBA history,[1][2] he was a ten-time NBA All-Star, and won two NBA championships (2008, 2013) with the Celtics and Heat respectively. He also won an Olympic gold medal as a member of the 2000 United States men's basketball team. Allen is the NBA's all-time leader in career three-point field goals made in both the regular and postseason.[3] He has acted in two films, one of which was a lead role in the 1998 Spike Lee film He Got Game.</p>
